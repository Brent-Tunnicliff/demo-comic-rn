# demo-comic-rn

Simple React Native project for use of demonstrating my skills during reqruitment.
It calls the [open api](https://any-api.com/xkcd_com/xkcd_com/docs/API_Description) for retriving the xkcd comics.
This API only supports getting one commic at a time, so need to plan out smart ways to use it quickly and efficiently.

## Setup

Install React Native dependancies found [here](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup?guide=native&platform=ios#installing-dependencies).
Then run the following to get the project ready for running:
    - `yarn install`
    - `bundle install`
    - `cd ios && bundle exec pod install`
